1. Design an original T-Shirt and print it on the Brother GT-361 printer. It must be an original design and cannot use any copyrighted materials. The t-shirt must be about Hudson, WRA or Ohio. We are having a contest to see who can create a shirt that possibly will be featured in a business downtown. Make sure to include your original files, pictures of the process and finished product.

2. You also will need to complete your dye sublimination project on the Sawgrass 800 printer. In your portfolio, discuss how the process of dye sublimation works and what advantages does dye sublimation hold over UV printing. Include your original files and pictures of the final dye sublimination project. You can choose any of the products that we have or the keychain or pencil case.
