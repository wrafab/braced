<h1> Dan Brace | About Me</h1>

  <h2> My name is Dan Brace. I am new sophomore at Reserve. I recently just moved to Bratenahl, near Cleveland, from Cincinnati. Before I came to Reserve, I took an engineering at my old school, Indian Hill High School. I really enjoy engineering and want to pursue a career in it in the future.</p>
